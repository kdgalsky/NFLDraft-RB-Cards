This project is my 2025 NFL Draft RB Cards inspired by JFreshHockey's player cards for the NHL.

I wanted to create easy visualizations to display a prospects composite ranking vs their expected value based on mock drafts.

I used data from AWS Draft Combine IQ and PFF to create the composite ranks. I then found a player's expected value rank by subtracting their composite rank from the their consesus mock draft rank.

There is also similairty % on the cards that was created by using a databse of 100+ RB prospects since 2022 and finding the euclidian distance from each prospect.
