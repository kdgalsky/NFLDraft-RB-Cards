This project is my 2025 NFL Draft RB Cards inspired by JFreshHockey's player cards for the NHL.

I wanted to create easy visualizations to display a prospects composite ranking vs their expected value based on mock drafts.

I used data from AWS Draft Combine IQ and PFF to create the composite ranks and then found their expected value rank by subtracting this from the player's consesus mock draft rank.

There is also similairty % on the cards that was created by using a databse of 100+ RB prospects since 2022 and finding the euclidian distance from each prospect.
